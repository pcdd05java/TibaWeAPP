# TibaWeAPP
I had attended to a Java programming boot camp from 2018.12~2019.05. 
For our graduated project, our group(6ppl) decided to built an Information System for the education institute where we learn programming, and I was in charged for the whole APP system, including back-end. (Others were for the website).

This is my 1st Android APP project in learning JAVA and Android. 
This APP was aimed for built an Information System for the education institute where I learn programming.
